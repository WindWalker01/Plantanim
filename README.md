# 🌱 Project Plantanim

## Overview

**Project Plantanim** is a mobile application designed to support small-scale farmers in **Abucay, Bataan, Philippines** through **localized weather forecasting** and **farming planning assistance**. The project responds to the increasing vulnerability of agriculture to extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and droughts—particularly in Central Luzon, the country’s primary rice-producing region.

Unlike existing agricultural apps in the Philippines that focus on isolated farming tasks, Plantanim aims to provide an **integrated, farmer-centered solution** that combines weather intelligence with actionable planning suggestions.

---

## Problem Context

Farmers in Central Luzon experience recurring crop losses due to:

* Unpredictable weather patterns
* Limited access to localized and timely forecasts
* Lack of integrated digital tools for planning farming activities

Many existing solutions:

* Are not localized
* Require high data usage
* Assume high digital literacy
* Do not integrate weather forecasts directly into farming decisions

**Project Plantanim** is designed to address these gaps.

---

## Objectives

* Provide **localized and understandable weather forecasts** for farmers
* Offer **practical farming suggestions** aligned with upcoming weather conditions
* Reduce weather-related crop losses through proactive planning
* Ensure high **acceptability and usability** among farmers with varied digital literacy

---

## Target Users

* Small-scale farmers in **Abucay, Bataan**
* Primarily rice farmers, with support for other crops (corn, vegetables, root crops)
* Users with:

  * Smartphones
  * Limited or unstable internet access
  * Minimal experience with advanced digital tools

---

## Core Features

* 🌦 **Localized Weather Forecasting**

  * Short-term and multi-day outlooks
  * Focus on rainfall, temperature, and extreme weather alerts

* 🌾 **Farming Planning Suggestions**

  * Weather-based recommendations (e.g., planting delays, harvest timing)
  * Designed to align with local farming cycles

* 📱 **Farmer-Friendly Interface**

  * Simple layouts
  * Minimal text and cognitive load
  * Clear visual cues

* 📶 **Low Data & Offline Considerations**

  * Optimized for low-bandwidth environments
  * Designed with rural connectivity constraints in mind

## Theoretical Foundations

Project Plantanim is grounded in established technology adoption and acceptability models:

### 1. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)

* **Perceived Usefulness (PU)** – Does the app genuinely help farmers?
* **Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)** – Is it easy to learn and operate?

### 2. Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA)

* Affective Attitude
* Burden (time, cost, effort)
* Ethicality (data privacy, trust)
* Intervention/System Coherence
* Opportunity Costs
* Perceived Effectiveness
* Self-Efficacy

### 3. Diffusion of Innovations (DOI)

* Relative Advantage
* Compatibility with existing practices
* Trialability and observability

These frameworks guide both **app design** and **research evaluation**.

---

## Research Component

Project Plantanim is also an academic study that evaluates the **acceptability of the application among local farmers**.

* Research Design: Descriptive and comparative
* Data Collection:

  * Survey questionnaires
  * Focused interviews
* Analysis:

  * Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, frequency)
  * Inferential tests (ANOVA, Independent Samples t-Test)

The findings will inform future app improvements and policy recommendations for LGUs.

## Technology Stack (Planned / In Use)

* **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
* **Platform:** Android-first
* **APIs:** Weather data APIs (to be selected)
* **Design Approach:** Mobile-first, accessibility-focused

---

## Design Principles

* Simplicity over complexity
* Clear language over technical jargon
* Practical value over feature bloat
* Respect for farmers’ time, data, and resources

---

## Non-Goals

Project Plantanim is **not** intended to:

* Replace agricultural extension workers
* Act as a full farm management or accounting system
* Serve as a marketplace or trading platform

---

## Future Directions

* Integration with PAGASA advisories
* LGU and extension office collaboration
* Expanded crop support
* Training modules to improve digital self-efficacy
